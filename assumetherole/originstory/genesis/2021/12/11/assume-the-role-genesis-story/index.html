<meta name="description" content="Assume the Role™ - what the heck does that mean? I can imagine for users coming across my personal blog and professional portfolio site for the first time that one of their first questions for me would be: “Assume the Role™ - what the heck does that mean?” The short answer: Assume the Role™ (ATR™ for we lovers of all things acronym) is my attempt to form my own personal brand, and therefore the name of my blog. Assume the Role™ - Origin Story The logical very next question they might have would be: “Ahh ok you’re launching your own brand, I can respect that! BUT - you still haven’t told me what the heck Assume the Role™ specifically means! Why oh why did you choose Assume the Role™?!” So - now for the long answer. I spent a lot of nights and weekends “trying on” more potential names for my own brand that I have forgotten more of them than I can recall. Given my 15 year career as an enterprise cloud data and software engineer who is used to either having full conversations with colleagues in “acronym” and assigning source files, variable names, tables, columns, indexes, etc with long boring extremely literal names like SPROC_GET_CUSTOMER_DATA_BY_ORDER_ID - you can surely imagine how bad some of my initial ideas were. After many attempts and seeking input from friends, family, and of course ICANN Lookup to be sure I could register the domain name, I arrived at Assume the Role™ Assume the Role™ - Deeper Meaning For my fellow Cloud Engineers with AWS (Amazon Web Services) DevOps experience - the name might not be all too foreign. When following best practice for RBAC (role based access control) using AWS’s IAM (Identity and Access Management) Service - engineers define policies which are assigned to roles, and individual users or groups are then assigned roles which they can then “assume” and be issued temporary credentials through the AWS STS (Security Token Service).

<p>I can imagine for users coming across my personal blog and professional portfolio site for the first time that one of their first questions for me would be: “Assume the Role™ - what the heck does that mean?”</p>

<p>The short answer: Assume the Role™ (ATR™ for we lovers of all things <em>acronym</em>) is my attempt to form my own personal brand, and therefore the name of my blog.</p>

<h3 id="assume-the-role---origin-story">Assume the Role™ - Origin Story</h3>

<p>The logical very next question they might have would be: “Ahh ok you’re launching your own brand, I can respect that! BUT - you still haven’t told me what the heck Assume the Role™ specifically means! Why oh why did you choose Assume the Role™?!”</p>

<p>So - now for the long answer. I spent a lot of nights and weekends “trying on” more potential names for my own brand that I have forgotten more of them than I can recall.</p>

<p>Given my 15 year career as an enterprise cloud data and software engineer who is used to either having full conversations with colleagues in “acronym” and assigning source files, variable names, tables, columns, indexes, etc with long boring extremely literal names like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SPROC_GET_CUSTOMER_DATA_BY_ORDER_ID</code> - you can surely imagine how bad some of my initial ideas were.</p>

<h3 id="assume-the-role---deeper-meaning">Assume the Role™ - Deeper Meaning</h3>

<p>For my fellow Cloud Engineers with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/">AWS (Amazon Web Services) DevOps</a> experience - the name might not be all too foreign.</p>
