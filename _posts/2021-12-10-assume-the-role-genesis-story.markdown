### Assume the Role&trade; - what the heck does that mean?

I can imagine for users coming across my personal blog and professional portfolio site for the first time that one of their first questions for me would be: "Assume the Role&trade; - what the heck does that mean?"

The short answer: Assume the Role&trade; (ATR&trade; for we lovers of all things _acronym_) is my attempt to form my own personal brand, and therefore the name of my blog.

### Assume the Role&trade; - Origin Story

The logical very next question they might have would be: "Ahh ok you're launching your own brand, I can respect that! BUT - you still haven't told me what the heck Assume the Role&trade; specifically means! Why oh why did you choose Assume the Role&trade;?!"

So - now for the long answer. I spent a lot of nights and weekends "trying on" more potential names for my own brand that I have forgotten more of them than I can recall. 

Given my 15 year career as an enterprise cloud data and software engineer who is used to either having full conversations with colleagues in "acronym" and assigning source files, variable names, tables, columns, indexes, etc with long boring extremely literal names like `SPROC_GET_CUSTOMER_DATA_BY_ORDER_ID` - you can surely imagine how bad some of my initial ideas were.

After many attempts and seeking input from friends, family, and of course [ICANN Lookup](https://lookup.icann.org/) to be sure I could register the domain name, I arrived at Assume the Role&trade;

### Assume the Role&trade; - Deeper Meaning

For my fellow Cloud Engineers with [AWS (Amazon Web Services) DevOps](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/) experience - the name might not be all too foreign.

When following best practice for [RBAC (role based access control)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) using [AWS's IAM (Identity and Access Management) Service](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) - engineers define policies which are assigned to roles, and individual users or groups are then assigned roles which they can then **"assume"** and be issued temporary credentials through the [AWS STS (Security Token Service)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/welcome.html).

I drew my inspiration from that concept - but that's not the whole story. I wanted Assume the Role&trade; to have deeper meaning.

For me, Assume the Role&trade; is a play on words and knod to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) (which I've built my career on) - but its true meaning is to represent the need for Enterprise DevOps Engineers like myself to "wear many hats", never stop learning, and to steal a term from our honorable [US Marine Corps Purpose](https://www.marines.com/about-the-marine-corps/who-are-the-marines/purpose.html): **"IAO (improvise adapt overcome)"** by pivoting on a moments notice, "answer the call" whenever needed, **"Assume the Role&trade;"**, accepting nothing less than success when transforming challenging business initiatives into innovative, yet sustaining, technology solutions on a daily basis.

Pretty cool, eh? I designed the logos myself - and while I know I'm no graphic artist - I feel all the elements are inclusive of the genesis and culture of what Assume the Role&trade; means to me!

_(Sneak Preview: Come back soon for a companion to this post where I share my experience creating the Assume the Role&trade; Logo Mark and why I chose the elements I did!)_

Now that you know what Assume the Role&trade; means to me - I hope it inspires you to forge your own definition of what Assume the Role&trade; means to you - and come back from time to time to contribute to the community I hope to build here!

Cheers Mates!
