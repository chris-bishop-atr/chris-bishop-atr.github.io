My name is Chris Bishop. I am a Cloud Software Engineer with 14+ years of success transforming challenging business initiatives into innovative, yet sustaining, technology solutions. I have a demonstrated history of expertise leveraging emerging technology to manage multiple production workloads as a key member of the Core Engineering Team for an industry leading SaaS, Data, and Analytics provider. Over my career I have established a proven track record of solving complex engineering problems using fully automated Declarative Build and Deploy Pipelines through multiple AWS Cloud-hosted environments at enterprise scale. Equally capable of collaborating effectively with cross-functional project teams or working independently to enhance performance, boost competitive advantage, and increase bottom-line gains.

In the table below you will find a summary of the tools and technologies I use on a daily basis.
